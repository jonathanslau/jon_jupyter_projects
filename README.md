## math_and_cats

Cat fur thoroughly permeates my living space. I vacuum frequently, but the cat fur returns. My possessions, my clothes, my life, enveloped by it. I cannot escape the cat fur.

For years, I have been resigned to this. I still am. I have accepted it as the way of life. My mind has reasoned that there is more cat fur simply because there is more cat. More cat means exponentially more surface area. 

All else equal, more surface area means there is more fur for getting on your clothes. But assumptions must be tested. They must be quantified.

I will build a web tool to estimate my cat's surface area. The tool will allow others to graph and compare their cat quantitatively and visually next to mine. We'll have some fun drawing kitties with 3d shapes.
